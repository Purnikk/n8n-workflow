### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Full Workflow Overview

![Workflow](https://github.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/blob/main/F5-BOT/Screenshots/01-Work-flow.png?raw=true)

This is the full n8n pipeline showing all the steps from Gmail fetch to Gemini LLM filtering and Google Sheets output. It‚Äôs clean, logical, and modular.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ F5Bot Email Label (Gmail)

![Label](https://github.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/blob/main/F5-BOT/Screenshots/02-label-mail.png?raw=true)

Once [F5Bot](https://f5bot.com) is set up with keywords like `Notion`, `freelance`, `time tracking`, etc., it emails you whenever these terms show up.

‚úÖ In Gmail:
- Create a filter for `From: alert@f5bot.com`  
- Apply the label `keyword-leads`  
This label will be used in the Gmail node inside n8n.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Gmail Node ‚Äì n8n Fetch

![Gmail](https://github.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/blob/main/F5-BOT/Screenshots/03-mail-node.png?raw=true)

This Gmail node fetches emails labeled `keyword-leads`. It:

- Pulls multiple emails using `Get Many`  
- Extracts content from each F5Bot alert  
- These contain both the keyword trigger + raw links (some ads/redirects)

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ API Metadata Fetch

![API](https://github.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/blob/main/F5-BOT/Screenshots/04-api.png?raw=true)

Once clean Reddit URLs are extracted, the Reddit API is called using the `post_id` or `comment_id`.  
It returns structured data like:

- `title`  
- `selftext`  
- `author`  
- Nested fields like `children` (comment structure)

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Merge Logic ‚Äì Body or Title

![Merge](https://github.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/blob/main/F5-BOT/Screenshots/05-merge.png?raw=true)

This step ensures useful context for filtering:

- If `selftext` exists ‚Üí it's used as description  
- Else ‚Üí fallback to the post `title`  
Some posts only have a title, which may still be valuable.

This merged field is what we send to Gemini next.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Gemini LLM Classifier

![Gemini](https://github.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/blob/main/F5-BOT/Screenshots/06-agent.png?raw=true)

Gemini reviews the merged content and returns:

```json
{
  "relevant": "yes"
}
```

Only relevant leads move forward. This step filters out:

- Spam  
- Low-quality or off-topic posts  
- Link dumps or joke replies

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Field Collector (Set Node)

![Set](https://github.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/blob/main/F5-BOT/Screenshots/07-collect-fields.png?raw=true)

Here we create the final lead structure, including:

- `reddit_url`  
- `description`  
- `keyword` (triggered word)  
- `author`

This is what‚Äôs logged into the spreadsheet.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Google Sheets Output

![Sheets](https://github.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/blob/main/F5-BOT/Screenshots/08-g-sheets.png?raw=true)

Each relevant lead is saved into Google Sheets.

‚úÖ De-duplication is handled using the `url`  
‚úÖ Sheet becomes a live list of opportunities, questions, or discussions around your niche

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Smart Filtering Logic

- Gmail filter limits emails to only F5Bot alerts  
- HTML parsing removes redirect or ad links  
- Reddit API ensures we only process posts by real (not deleted) authors  
- Gemini confirms whether it's worth tracking

## ‚ùì FAQs

**Can this monitor Hacker News too?**  
Yes. F5Bot supports both Reddit and Hacker News keywords.

**Can I run this every hour?**  
Absolutely. Use Cron or a webhook trigger in n8n.

**Does it work with Outlook?**  
Not directly. Gmail works best with OAuth and label-based filtering.

**How are duplicates avoided?**  
The Google Sheets node checks existing entries by `url`.

**Can I track multiple keywords?**  
Yes ‚Äî just add them to your F5Bot dashboard. Each mention becomes a new email.
