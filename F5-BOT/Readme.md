# Reddit Leads Automation ‚Äì For Freelancers, Startups & Small Businesses

This workflow scans Reddit for posts where people are **asking for help**, **looking to hire**, or **seeking services** ‚Äî such as creative freelancers, startup collaborators, virtual assistants, or tool experts.

It combines **F5Bot**, **n8n**, **Gemini LLM**, and **Google Sheets** to turn raw Reddit alerts into **structured leads your business can act on**.

You can customize this to track:
- People needing design/video/editing help ‚úÖ
- Businesses hiring VAs or marketers ‚úÖ
- Startup founders looking for tools/feedback ‚úÖ
- Local service requests (e.g. posters, templates, automation help) ‚úÖ



F5Bot watches Reddit and emails you whenever one of those appears.  
In this workflow, I‚Äôve used it to track terms related to **video editing, graphic design, slides, logos, posters, etc.**

## üî• Why I Built This

Reddit has real people saying things like:

> "Looking for someone to edit my YouTube videos"  
> "Need help creating a logo or presentation"  
> "Any video editors open for a revenue share collab?"

But most posts are:
- Self-promos ("I can edit your videos!")
- Dead (deleted authors, removed posts)
- Feedback threads or memes

So I built this to:
- Parse F5Bot email alerts via Gmail
- Extract Reddit post links (post or comment)
- Pull full Reddit content via API
- Use a Gemini LLM to check if the post is a **genuine freelance request**
- Store valid ones in a Google Sheet for follow-up

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This system runs inside **n8n (Docker self-hosted)** and combines Gmail, Reddit API, LLM classification, and Sheets:

### 1. F5Bot ‚Üí Gmail ‚Üí n8n
- F5Bot sends alerts to Gmail (label: `F5BOT`)
- n8n fetches emails from this label
- Extracts all Reddit links from the email HTML (handles posts & comments)

### 2. Reddit Metadata Extraction
- Uses Reddit API `/api/info` to fetch:
  - `title`, `selftext`, `author`, etc.
- Discards:
  - `[deleted]` authors
  - `[removed]` or empty text

### 3. Classify Using Gemini
- Sends text to **Google Gemini 2.5**
- Response is either:
  ```json
  { "relevant": true } or { "relevant": false }
### ‚úÖ Classification Logic

Keeps only relevant posts:

- People **asking for help**
- Mentioning tools like **CapCut, Canva, Premiere**
- Showing clear **intent to hire**

### üì§ 4. Store in Google Sheets

Adds a row for each valid lead with:

- `url`
- `keyword`
- `author`
- `description`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Desktop Note

If the **"Contact Me"** button doesn‚Äôt work:

- Try **right-clicking** (or long-press on mobile) and choosing **‚ÄúOpen in new tab‚Äù**
- Or make sure your **default email app** (like Gmail) is properly configured

This works best on mobile or systems with a mail client set up.
