# Reddit Freelance Leads ‚Äì Video Editing, Design & Creative Help

This workflow scans Reddit for posts where people are **looking to hire or collaborate** with freelance editors, designers, and other creatives. It uses **F5Bot**, **n8n**, **LLMs (Gemini)**, and **Google Sheets** to turn noisy Reddit alerts into **structured, outreach-ready leads**.

## üõ∞Ô∏è What Is F5Bot?

[F5Bot](https://f5bot.com) is a free Reddit keyword alert service that emails you when specific terms show up in Reddit posts or comments.

You define keywords like:
- `video editing`
- `capcut help`
- `need a designer`
- `thumbnail feedback`
- `hire a freelancer`

F5Bot watches Reddit and emails you whenever one of those appears.  
In this workflow, I‚Äôve used it to track terms related to **video editing, graphic design, slides, logos, posters, etc.**

## üî• Why I Built This

Reddit has real people saying things like:

> "Looking for someone to edit my YouTube videos"  
> "Need help creating a logo or presentation"  
> "Any video editors open for a revenue share collab?"

But most posts are:
- Self-promos ("I can edit your videos!")
- Dead (deleted authors, removed posts)
- Feedback threads or memes

So I built this to:
- Parse F5Bot email alerts via Gmail
- Extract Reddit post links (post or comment)
- Pull full Reddit content via API
- Use a Gemini LLM to check if the post is a **genuine freelance request**
- Store valid ones in a Google Sheet for follow-up

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This system runs inside **n8n (Docker self-hosted)** and combines Gmail, Reddit API, LLM classification, and Sheets:

### 1. F5Bot ‚Üí Gmail ‚Üí n8n
- F5Bot sends alerts to Gmail (label: `F5BOT`)
- n8n fetches emails from this label
- Extracts all Reddit links from the email HTML (handles posts & comments)

### 2. Reddit Metadata Extraction
- Uses Reddit API `/api/info` to fetch:
  - `title`, `selftext`, `author`, etc.
- Discards:
  - `[deleted]` authors
  - `[removed]` or empty text

### 3. Classify Using Gemini
- Sends text to **Google Gemini 2.5**
- Response is either:
  ```json
  { "relevant": true } or { "relevant": false }
### ‚úÖ Classification Logic

Keeps only relevant posts:

- People **asking for help**
- Mentioning tools like **CapCut, Canva, Premiere**
- Showing clear **intent to hire**

### üì§ 4. Store in Google Sheets

Adds a row for each valid lead with:

- `url`
- `keyword`
- `author`
- `description`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Desktop Note

If the **"Contact Me"** button doesn‚Äôt work:

- Try **right-clicking** (or long-press on mobile) and choosing **‚ÄúOpen in new tab‚Äù**
- Or make sure your **default email app** (like Gmail) is properly configured

This works best on mobile or systems with a mail client set up.
