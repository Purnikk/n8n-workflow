- Field collector  
- Google Sheets writer

This gives a bird's-eye view of the automation.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ User Input Form

![Input Form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/main/restaurant-leads/screenshots/02-testform.png)

You can input:

- Subreddit name (like `r/hyderabadfood`)  
- Search keywords (`restaurant`, `food truck`, etc.)

This makes your automation flexible and reusable for different cities or niches.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Reddit Fetch Module

![Reddit Fetch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/main/restaurant-leads/screenshots/03-reddit.png)

This node fetches recent Reddit posts via API and extracts:

- `title`, `body`, `author`, `url`, `created_utc`

It also applies filters like:

- Recent posts only (e.g., last 3 days)  
- Keyword match (e.g., `restaurant`, `dining`, etc.)

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Field Mapping Setup

![Field Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/main/restaurant-leads/screenshots/04-Required%20fields.png)

This node defines the schema for final output like:

- `location`, `cuisine`, `budget`, `type`, and `intent`

It ensures uniform structure for storage or display.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Relevance Classifier (Gemini)

![Relevance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/main/restaurant-leads/screenshots/05-relevance.png)

This Gemini LLM node checks if the post is actually relevant for restaurant leads.

It looks for:

- Business-related context  
- Intent to buy, promote, or ask about food-related services

If not relevant, the post is skipped.

Sample output:

```json
{
  "relevant": true
}
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ LLM Extraction Agent

![Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/main/restaurant-leads/screenshots/06-agent.png)

Only runs for relevant posts. Gemini extracts structured fields like:

- `location` ‚Äì area or city mentioned  
- `cuisine` ‚Äì e.g., biryani, caf√©, Chinese  
- `intent` ‚Äì opening a restaurant, asking for suggestions  
- `budget` ‚Äì if mentioned  

You can easily customize prompts for local business intelligence.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Final Structuring

![Collect Fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/main/restaurant-leads/screenshots/07-collect%20fields.png)

This combines:

- Reddit metadata (`author`, `url`, `created_utc`)  
- Extracted fields from Gemini  
- Ensures everything is clean and formatted for output

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Google Sheets Output

![Sheet Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purnikk/n8n-workflow/main/restaurant-leads/screenshots/08-sheet.png)

Final structured leads are pushed into Google Sheets.

- One row per lead  
- De-duplicates using the `url`  
- Sheet becomes your lead CRM for outreach or analysis

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Smart Filtering Logic

To reduce spam and avoid unnecessary LLM usage:

- Filters posts by **recency** (last 3 days)  
- Filters by **keywords** like `restaurant`, `food`, `launch`  
- Relevance classifier ensures only business-useful content is processed

---
